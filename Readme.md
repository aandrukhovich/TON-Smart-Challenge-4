# Ton Smart Challenge 4

⌛ 10-days contest of writing a smart-contracts for TON blockchain 💎.

Possible to use **FunC**(dialect of C) or **Fift**(ASM-like) to write a code. Wrappers and tests are written on **TypeScript** using **Blueprint** framework.

See [the original contest repository](https://github.com/ton-community/tsc4) and [community solutions](https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/examples#ton-smart-challenge-4).


# Results:

✅ Tasks solved: **5/5** 

🏆 Place **81/220** (top 37%)

💎 Prize: A lot of fun and 150 TONs


## Task 1
🚀 GasValue: 1589005

💯 Points: 5.396919110103502

[💻 Code](contracts/1.fc) [🌯 Wrapper](wrappers/Task1.fc) [🟢 Tests](tests/Task1.spec.ts)

Task to meet the language and provided tools for developing. Firstly solution was written with recursion (score 5.16), then optimized (5.21) and finally rewritten using Lisp-like list (5.39)

## Task 2
🚀 GasValue: 16366081

💯 Points: 5.976338143715719

[💻 Code](contracts/2.fc) [🌯 Wrapper](wrappers/Task2.fc) [🟢 Tests](tests/Task2.spec.ts)

The goal is to multiply two matrices. Task to become familiar with memory in general and with tuples in particular in FunC.

The naive algorithm in pure FunC takes a 5.97 score, so almost no need to optimizations.


## Task 3
🚀 GasValue: 73738596

💯 Points: 5.291969984009893

[💻 Code](contracts/3.fc) [🌯 Wrapper](wrappers/Task3.fc) [🟢 Tests](tests/Task3.spec.ts)

Probably the hardest task in the contest. Do a string find-and-replace-all, where strings are binary and presented as integers in linked list of cells, such that bits from the end of cell1 are connected with first bits of cell2.
The first attempt scores 5.29 and hadn't edited.


## Task 4
🚀 GasValue: 333391563

💯 Points: 5.644994443586982

[💻 Code](contracts/4.fc) [🌯 Wrapper](wrappers/Task4.fc) [🟢 Tests](tests/Task4.spec.ts)

Implement a Caesar cipher encryption and decryption functions.



## Task 5
🚀 GasValue: 1729374

💯 Points: 5.427721800691111

[💻 Code](contracts/5.fc) [🌯 Wrapper](wrappers/Task5.fc) [🟢 Tests](tests/Task5.spec.ts)

Find a Fibonacci sequence from N to N+k elements.

The biggest challenge was FunC compiler that produces a very unefficient Fift code for cycles in this task. So for a score 5.9-5.95 task should be written in Fift.

I tried a two approaches: 

1. the naive one with cycle
2. fast doubling method to find a Fibonacci(n) with O(logN).
  
Both provide similar results around 5.42. Best solutions use cycle code written in Fift and get score around 5.9.
